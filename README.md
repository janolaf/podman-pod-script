# podman-pod-script
Stores my shell and kube pod scripts created by podman. 
Some have not been tested in a while.

Most are converted Docker Compose scripts.

## Current SHell Scripts 
* photoprism (converted docker-compose)
* audiobookshelf
* calibre-web
* photoview
* typemill
* audiobookshelf

## Current Kube YAML
* heimdall
* jupyter
* mealie
* valhiem docker server
* authentik

# TODO
Need to add Udici instructions. If you use SELinux, Audiobookshelf will be 
prevented from playing audio files from a shared directory.

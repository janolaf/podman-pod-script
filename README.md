# podman-pod-script

Most of the scripts are old. Moving everything over to quadlet files.

## Current Quadlets

- Mealie
- Audiobookshelf
- Minecraft Bedrock Server

## Current SHell Scripts

- photoprism (converted docker-compose)

## Current Kube YAML

- valhiem docker server
- pgAdmin4

# TODO

Need to add Udici instructions. If you use SELinux, Audiobookshelf will be prevented from playing audio files from a shared directory.

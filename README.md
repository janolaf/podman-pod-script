# podman-pod-script
Stores my shell and kube pod scripts created by podman. 
Some have not been tested in a while.

Most are converted Docker Compose scripts.

## Current Scripts 
* photoview (converted docker-compose)
* photoprism (converted docker-compose)
* Nextcloud-postgres-redis under CC BY-NC 4.0

## Future 
* Paperless-ng 
* Mayan EDMS
* Jellyfin (Linuxserver.io)
* gitea-postgres
* minecraft
* prometheus-grafana


Unfortunately I need to go back and comment my shell scripts.

# Podman Scripts   

This repository is a collection of shellscripts, kubernetes yaml, and podman quadlet files to deploy containers using podman.

Most scripts take the projects docker compose.yaml file and translate them into a podman friendly format.

Many of the scripts need to be fixed or retested, as it has been years since I have touched them.

All examples here have been deployed on Fedora and either Red Hat Enterprise 9 or Centos Streams 9.

## Current Quadlets

- Mealie
- Audiobookshelf
- Minecraft Bedrock Server

## Current SHell Scripts

- photoprism (converted docker-compose)

## Current Kube YAML

- valhiem docker server
- pgAdmin4
